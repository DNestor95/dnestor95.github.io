        <h1>Finding a way to make an impact</h1>
        <p>During the last year of my degree I had become more and more disillusioned 
            with the idea of getting my BS in Computer Science and was starting to lose hope that 
            I would be able to find a job after my degree was over. Since I started school my main 
            focus had been in trying to get myself a better job that would result in a better life for myself. 
            It was not until the last two semesters of my time at texas state that I started to actually enjoy the classes that I was taking. 
            And oddly enough I started to enjoy the math classes more than the computer science classes. I started to see the bigger picture of what math is for computer 
            science. A pure foundation for the concepts that I was attempting to learn. Discrete Math 2 with Dr. Cameron Farnsworth is probably the most eye opening moment 
            for me in my entire time in academia. This class was hard to be frank. I am by no means the smartest person in any room that i step into but nor am I the most challenged. 
            And this class was paired for a summer semester with data structures and algorithms. Which is a pillar of the computer Science world and will engross most people for a 
            lifetime attempting to leetcode themselves into the stratosphere. The main take away is that the math that I was doing 30 minutes before my data structures class was 
            the exact math that I needed in order to understand what it was that I was attempting to create with these systems. Almost every single day I would learn a topic in 
            discrete and then go and apply the topic in my data structures class. It was oddly satisfying since I have been someone who struggles with math forever and had a 
            general disdain for the subject as a whole. Since then I have taken on more and more math based topic as interests and have shifted my focus in computer science to 
            learning more about low level math intensive operations. Since finding an interest I can maintain long term is difficult. Now i am currently working on various projects 
            that deal with applied math and machine learning while applying for engineering and data science positions.
